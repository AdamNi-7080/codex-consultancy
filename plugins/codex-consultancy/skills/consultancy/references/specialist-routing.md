# Specialist routing

Choose the smallest set of functional roles that remove the actual uncertainty. This is an idea menu, not an organisation chart, installed-agent catalogue, or required staffing list. The manager hires the role suitable for the task at hand. If no pattern fits, define a task-specific persona; if the needed expertise or framing is unclear, assign a bounded role-discovery brief before staffing delivery work.

| Need | Role pattern | Owns | Must return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unknown code or system path | Mapper | entry points, call/state path, side-effect and policy boundaries | exact paths/symbols, confidence, branch points, fastest checks for unknowns |
| Uncertain external fact or API behaviour | Evidence researcher | source-backed claim set | sources, confirmed facts, contradictions, open proof |
| Reproducible defect | Reproducer | minimal reproduction and observed/expected behaviour | steps, environment, evidence, whether reproduced |
| Material proposed idea needs challenge | Hypothesis challenger | fair test of the candidate against evidence and a credible alternative | support/qualify/contradict verdict, evidence, confidence, decision-changing unknowns |
| Missing task framing or expertise | Role scout | the smallest appropriate specialist brief and hiring rationale | candidate role, why it fits, scope, evidence needs, cheaper or simpler alternative |
| Requirement ambiguity | Business analyst | decisions, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and non-goals | clarified scope, decision log, acceptance tests, unresolved choices |
| API or integration change | Contract verifier | caller/provider contract and compatibility risks | inputs/outputs, error cases, versioning risk, proof still needed |
| Data or migration change | Data/migration reviewer | invariants, backfill/rollback safety, and evidence plan | affected data, failure modes, validation and recovery plan |
| Performance concern | Performance investigator | measurement plan and identified bottleneck | baseline, measurement method, evidence, improvement hypothesis |
| Security or privacy boundary | Security/privacy reviewer | threat or data-flow risk assessment | trust boundary, concrete risks, mitigations, residual risk |
| Release or operational change | Deployment reviewer | rollout, observability, and rollback readiness | release checks, monitoring signals, rollback path, blockers |
| User interface risk | Accessibility or UX tester | task-based acceptance and accessibility gaps | flows tested, defects, accessibility evidence, residual risk |
| Bounded implementation | Implementer | one explicit write scope | changes, focused verification, residual risk |
| Cross-cutting change | Boundary specialist | one risky interface: auth, data, async, API, deployment, or privacy | contract/invariants, failure modes, impact on the plan |
| Quality decision | Independent reviewer or SET | acceptance, adversarial or black-box checks | findings with evidence, coverage gaps, verdict, residual risk |
| Incident or confusing failure | Incident investigator | timeline, hypotheses, and proof gaps | evidence timeline, ranked hypotheses, containment or next check |
| Build/tooling disruption | Build or tooling engineer | reproducible diagnosis and minimal repair | reproduction, affected environment, patch or workaround, verification |
| User-facing handoff | Technical writer | operator or user documentation from settled facts | audience fit, procedure, assumptions and missing evidence |

## Routing rules

- Start with a Mapper or Evidence researcher when the change owner or behaviour is uncertain. Their output is an input to later work, not a proposed patch.
- Use a Boundary specialist only for a material risk boundary; do not split ordinary implementation into artificial specialties.
- Give Implementers disjoint file or subsystem scopes. If the same write scope cannot be separated, sequence the work and make one Delivery Lead responsible for integration.
- Keep Independent reviewers and SET separate from the implementation they accept. Ask them to cover a normal path, a failure path, and a relevant integration edge when feasible.
- Select a Technical writer only when the deliverable needs durable user, operator, API, or decision documentation; do not use one to restate unsettled findings.
- Before inventing a role, check relevant project instructions, existing skills, available tools, and known workflow conventions. Reuse a project-specific capability when it fits; if a delegated role depends on that skill, its brief must require loading it before acting. Do not invent a generic persona that duplicates it.
- If the menu lacks a good fit, write a task-specific persona from the template below. If the task itself does not reveal the expertise needed, hire a Role scout first; it recommends a role and brief, but does not perform the delivery work unless separately assigned.
- Create a persistent custom agent only after a role pattern has repeated, has stable non-obvious instructions, and cannot be represented as a concise engagement brief. Otherwise use the transient role and the skill's existing reuse pre-check.

## Persona and brief template

Use this for every menu role and every new role. It must describe the work, not merely assert expertise.

```text
Role label: <specific, task-shaped name>
Persona: You are a <discipline or perspective>. Prioritise <outcome/risk>; be sceptical of <likely failure mode>.
Mission: <one bounded question, artifact, or change>
Why this role: <why this expertise/perspective fits this task now>
Owned output: <decision, evidence package, file scope, or test result>
Inputs: <minimum sources, paths, environment, and upstream results>
Context budget: <first-pass files/sources only; condition for widening the search>
Boundaries: <no-go areas, permissions, read/write scope, and assumptions not allowed>
Quality bar: <observable completion test and evidence required>
Dependencies: <what it waits for and who consumes the result>
Return format: <the applicable result-contract fields, concise>
Stop/escalate: <missing access, conflicting evidence, scope expansion, or repeated failed check that requires handoff>
```

When inventing a persona, use the task's domain, decision, failure modes, and acceptance evidence—not decorative seniority or a generic "expert" label. The model/effort allocation remains a separate risk and complexity decision.

## Result contract

Every specialist result should be concise and usable by the next role:

```text
Scope covered:
Confirmed evidence:
Inference / assumptions:
Unresolved questions and smallest next check:
Owned artifact or decision:
Verification performed:
Residual risk / handoff:
```

The manager may trim fields that do not apply, but must preserve the separation between evidence, inference, and unknowns.
