# Usage and execution audit

The audit checks efficiency without redoing domain work except for necessary sampling. The Manager can perform it; use an independent Auditor when that adds value. Inspect the live tool catalog and available telemetry, not merely documentation. If reads fail or sources are absent, name the gap and continue in proxy mode rather than inventing counters or blocking delivery.

## Live usage and billing evidence

At staffing and final handoff, and at justified intermediate audits, collect a fresh read-only usage snapshot when accessible before making usage-based recommendations. Combine adjacent checks where no meaningful execution intervened; do not poll continuously.

1. Discover any installed Usage & Billing skill/plugin and read its instructions if available. Use its applicable read-only token, usage, and billing tools. Check the active tool catalog (and tool search if supplied); do not equate an absent skill name with absent telemetry.
2. In the Codex desktop app, if exposed, call `codex_app__get_usage_limits({})` (or its available equivalent) for account limits. If only the Manager can access it, have the Manager read it and send the Auditor a timestamped, minimized snapshot. Prefer `rateLimitsByLimitId`; use the legacy `rateLimits` only as fallback, never sum both representations. For each available bucket/window record `usedPercent`, remaining percent clamped to 0–100, `windowDurationMins`, and `resetsAt` converted from Unix seconds to UTC. Missing fields mean unavailable, not zero.
3. Obtain task/agent token counters through the installed usage capability or runtime telemetry when exposed. Use `get_goal` only for an existing relevant goal; do not create a goal to manufacture telemetry. Record source, timestamp, attribution scope, and whether counters include descendants. Preserve input, cached-input, output, and reasoning distinctions where supplied; avoid double-counting cumulative snapshots or overlapping totals.
4. Compare current and previous readings only within the same source, scope, bucket, and reset window. Account limits are shared across tasks: percentage changes are not this team's token consumption. Account percentages cannot be converted into token counts or billing spend. Report actual token/cost data only when supplied by an applicable source; otherwise mark it unavailable. Do not substitute API organization billing for a ChatGPT subscription's usage.
5. Base recommendations on evidence: remove duplicated work, reduce oversized context, downshift bounded execution, or sequence noncritical agents when limits tighten. Protect critical review and acceptance criteria. Give the observation, affected agents, proposed change, and expected directional effect; never claim measured savings without measured attribution.

If a named plugin is absent, report that fact and use available native telemetry. Do not install an invented dependency or invoke resets, credit purchases, plan changes, or other billing mutations as part of an audit. Persist only compact aggregate readings needed for checkpoint comparisons, not account identifiers or raw usage payloads.


## Audit decision

Inspect model/effort and actual spawn settings, context size, duplicate investigation, idle handoffs, repeated failures, discarded work, and verification gaps. In proxy mode these support qualitative recommendations only, not token figures, utilization percentages, prices, or measured savings. Account telemetry can coexist with proxy-based task-efficiency findings; label each scope accurately.

Return concisely:

```text
Data basis: telemetry | proxies | mixed, with scopes
Source and timestamp: tools actually called; missing or failed sources
Snapshot/delta: comparable counters/windows only; attribution limitations
Findings: observed waste or quality risk with evidence
Actions: affected owners, change, and directional expected effect
Next checkpoint: event if needed
```

The Manager accepts, modifies, or rejects actionable recommendations, recording reasons for material decisions and broadcasting adopted guidance to affected agents. Cost optimization cannot override user intent, correctness, necessary review, or authorization. Never claim measured savings without measured attribution.
