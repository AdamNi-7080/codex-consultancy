# Operating model

## Staffing and capacity

Map the smallest complete team before work starts. Derive workstreams from required outputs, interfaces, and risk boundaries; assign one delivery owner to each, an integration owner when outputs must be combined, and a separate independent acceptance owner for every engagement. Stage launches by dependency, rather than deciding whether acceptance is needed after delivery. Do not create roles for status reporting, to fill capacity, or to split tightly coupled work merely for parallelism.

Before each hire, make a short comparative decision:

- **Need now:** Identify the mapped decision, artifact, or acceptance check, its consumer, and whether its inputs are ready. Keep later roles on the team map until their dependency is satisfied.
- **Best role and level:** Choose the specialist perspective and job level with the necessary tool access, autonomy, judgment, and clear write boundary. A role label or claim of expertise is not evidence of fit; use task evidence or a bounded discovery assignment when fit is uncertain.
- **Net value:** Count briefing, coordination, review, and integration work as well as the expected gain in speed or quality. Hire for independent judgment when correlated assumptions would otherwise weaken acceptance, even if it does not save time. Do not split a tightly coupled task just to run agents concurrently.
- **Success and exit:** Define the evidence that makes the output usable, the dependency that governs timing, and when to stop or replace the agent. Reserve capacity for the acceptance owner before filling optional delivery slots.

Keep the rationale to one or two sentences per material hire. Reassess when evidence changes; sunk briefing cost is not a reason to keep an ineffective role.

| Work shape | Typical ownership |
|---|---|
| Small reversible change | One implementer and a separate acceptance owner with focused checks |
| Substantial implementation | Delivery Lead integrates; contributors own separable components; independent acceptance owner |
| Research or investigation | Evidence owners for distinct questions where useful; one synthesis specialist and independent evidence review |
| High-risk cross-system work | Principal judgment for consequential decisions, a Delivery Lead and boundary specialists where needed, plus independent acceptance |

These are examples, not a fixed roster. A single delivery agent can own implementation and integration when there is only one output. Name a distinct acceptance owner before delivery; launch acceptance when there is useful evidence or an artifact to inspect. The Manager's final sign-off does not replace that independent check.

Inspect live capacity, whether the Manager counts toward it, and whether completed or idle agents retain slots. Do not assume waves release capacity. Reserve capacity for a fresh acceptance agent. If capacity blocks a required hire, queue the assignment and report the constraint; do not silently substitute the Manager or omit acceptance. Configuration changes may require a new task or app reload; do not change global capacity without authorization.

## Briefs and coordination

Use the persona and result contracts in [specialist-routing.md](specialist-routing.md) when defining roles. Every brief needs a concrete perspective, bounded mission, owned artifact or decision, inputs, authority/read-write scope, reporting line, dependencies, completion evidence, and stop/escalation condition. Include relevant project instructions and require loading any applicable project skill. State whether nested delegation is allowed; allow it only for designated leads with reserved capacity and the same allocation rules.

Give the first-pass context needed for the assignment. Let specialists expand their search when evidence warrants it, reporting why; this does not require a new user approval. Use artifact paths rather than repeated transcripts.

Before a parallel wave, identify its critical path, independent work, disjoint write scopes, required wait points, integration owner, and fallback for partial or contradictory results. Do not delegate an immediate local blocker merely to manufacture parallelism. Use concise messages for decisions and shared files for large artifacts; wait for milestones instead of polling.

Keep a compact roster:

```text
Agent ID | Assignment and job level | Reports to | Model/effort/fork actually requested | Observed settings if exposed | Owned artifacts | Status
```

Give each distinct assignment to a fresh agent. A follow-up may finish or correct only that agent's original assignment; it does not change runtime configuration. For a new task or a changed job level, spawn a new agent with a fresh brief and a concise handoff of accepted evidence and current decisions. Do not pass entire transcripts or repurpose an idle or completed agent.

## Evidence, integration, and recovery

Accept each result against its brief before downstream use. Confirm scope, artifact, evidence, assumptions, unresolved questions, and respected boundaries. Resolve conflicting findings against evidence and acceptance criteria rather than averaging conclusions. Preserve verified partial outputs and assign the smallest missing check or repair; do not restart good work unnecessarily.

After two unsuccessful attempts using substantially the same approach, change hypothesis, narrow scope, or escalate with the failed approach and evidence. Interrupt obsolete, duplicate, or out-of-scope work. Recover autonomously when possible; ask the user only when an actual decision or authorization is missing.

Contributors run focused checks. The integration owner validates combined behavior; the independent acceptance owner inspects the artifact and evidence and exercises relevant normal, failure, and integration paths. Coordinate suite ownership to avoid redundant full runs: one existing full run may supply shared evidence, with independent targeted checks rather than another identical full run. Rerun affected checks after meaningful changes. Separate-agent review alone does not prove independent evidence, and completion messages are not proof of correctness.

## Audits and skill reuse

Run staffing and final handoff controls using [usage-audit.md](usage-audit.md). Adjacent checks can share a snapshot when no meaningful execution intervened. Add an intermediate audit only for material changes, repeated failures, an expensive wave, blocking verification defects, usage pressure, or a user-requested review. Delegate a fresh Auditor only when independent assessment adds value; a focused acceptance reviewer may also audit if both checks belong to its original assignment.

Before spawning a Skill Maker, the Manager checks:

- repeated successful use or unusually strong evidence of generalization;
- stable, non-obvious guidance and a concrete future invocation;
- relevant installed skills, preferring a narrow extension over duplication;
- ability to exclude secrets and transient project state.

A successful one-off alone is insufficient. If an existing skill already covers the need, reuse it. If the check fails, retain a candidate and the missing evidence only when useful; do not block delivery. For a mature candidate within authorized scope, the Skill Maker loads the available skill-creator guidance, creates or updates the smallest useful skill, validates it, and reports its path. Serialize skill writes through the Manager. Defer installation or broader changes when authority is missing.

## Durable state

Use `.codex/consultancy/operating-log.md` in writable projects; for intentionally read-only tasks, keep equivalent state in task context and provide a concise handoff. Maintain:

```text
Current outcome and acceptance criteria:
Decisions, assumptions, and unresolved choices:
Full team map, job levels, ownership, dependencies, and launch checkpoints:
Adopted efficiency guidance and reasons:
Workflow candidates: evidence; observe | draft | validated | installed
Durable lessons and exceptions:
```

Update existing entries; do not accumulate stale status. Persist only compact aggregate telemetry needed for comparisons, never credentials, account identifiers, private chain-of-thought, full transcripts, or raw usage payloads. Every newly hired specialist receives the current relevant state. At closeout report outcome, verification, caveats, material ownership/audit changes, telemetry limitations, and any skill produced; omit empty administrative sections.
